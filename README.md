# tensorflow-classification
Simple code to demonstrate classification in Tensorflow. The code will build a classifier for houses.
The housing data contains features for each house like the number of bathrooms, price, and area.
I manually add labels to the data (good buy or bad buy) then given a new house, the model will predict whether or not it's a good buy or bad buy.
We use gradient descent as our optimization strategy.
